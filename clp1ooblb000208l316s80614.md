### **creation of directories:**

we can create directories by using mkdir command

```bash
$mkdir dir1 -->to create a directory
$mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 -->to create multiple directories
$mkdir dir1/dir2/dir3 -->to create dir3. But make sure dir1 and in that dir2 should be available already.
$mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3 -->-p means path of directories.
All directories in the specified path will be created.
```

### Remove directories:

we can remove directories by using rmdir command

```bash
$rmdir dir1 -->to remove empty directory dir1
$rmdir dir1 dir2 dir3 -->to remove multiple empty directories
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><code>rmdir command will work only for empty directories. If the directory is not empty then we will get an error. We cannot use rmdir for files.</code></div>
</div>

If the directory is not empty then to remove that directory we should use rm command.

All internal content also will be removed. rm command can work for files also.

```bash
$rm -r -->to delete non-empty directories
```

### Various options with rm command:

interactive Option(-i):- While removing files and directories, if we want confirmation then we have to use -i option.

```bash
$rm -ri
```

force removal(-f):- While removing files and directories, if we don't want any error messages, then we should use -f option. It is opposite to -i option.

```bash
$rm -rf
```

verbose Option(-v):- If we want to know the sequence of removals on the screen we should go for -v option.

```bash
$rm -rv
```
